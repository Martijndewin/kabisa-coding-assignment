# Assignment Kabisa

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run startData`

Runs a Json-server on port 3001 which is used to store user ratings of quotes.

## For this assignment I've implemented the following features

- Fetch quotes from an external service
- Share quotes on social media (npm package next-share)
- Allow users to rate quotes and view ther people's ratings (in this case a random rating is shown after rating yourself)

This has been my first react project and tried to follow best practices to the best of my capabilities.
